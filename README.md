# Introduction to CUDA
Welcome to our course on CUDA Programming! 

Please begin by cloning the course repository here: `git clone https://github.com/rahultoppur/CUDA.git`. 

A suggested course outline is provided, and you can "submit" your assignments by pushing any files you create to your repository (most assignments will ask you to modify the `README.md` as well).

## Course Outline
1. You can complete `module_1` before watching any of the lectures. It's mainly a review of C.
2. Watch Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 of the lectures
3. You should now be able to complete `module_2` through `module_4`
4. Watch Part 4 (some optional content)
5. Tell us what you think of the course by completing the survey [here](https://forms.gle/WciCCNqduc1RA4tm9)!
